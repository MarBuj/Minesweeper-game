Project of building a Minesweeper game in order to remember nostalgic times with Windows 98. This is how old I am. 

The biggest challenge - Javascript Recursive functions. The main goal - understanding its basis.
 
Main stack: 
- HTML;
- CSS;
- Javascript;
 
3rd party libs:
- Font Awesome for content icons;
- Bootstrap 5.0 for content styling;
- GSAP.js for a minimalistic content animations;

Rules of the game:

1. Avoid all the bombs and expose all the empty spaces to win Minesweeper.
2. The numbers on the board represent how many bombs are around the square.
3. The bombs could be above, below, right, left or diagonal to the square.
4. You can right click a square with the mouse to place a flag where you think a bomb is.
5. Use the left click button on the mouse to select a space on the grid. If you hit a bomb, you lose.
